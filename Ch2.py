#Chapter 2: Variables & Variable rules

#A variable is container for a value or a set of values.

print("Hello World!") #This is a standard command.

greeting = "Hello World!"
print(greeting) #The variable greeting has been assigned a value, and printed out.

Variable rules:
1. Use only letters, numbers and underscores, although no numbers at the start.
2. No spaces, only underscores.
3. Do not enclose variables with "".
4. Do not use Python reserved keywords for names of variables.
5. Make variable names short and meaningful.
6. Ensure the variable is spelled the same way throughout your code.
7. Defining variables must occur before their use in Python.
